# How I Built My First Blog


I'm incredibly excited to finally share my first developer blog, **DevView**! This project was born from my desire to have a space I truly own. ðŸ˜„ I wanted my own brand, which is why I chose to go with **Hugo** instead of a platform like Hashnode or Medium (I have accounts there too, but I craved full control).


## Why I Picked Hugo And Netlify


I picked Hugo over something like Next.js because I wanted to try something newâ€”and Iâ€™m so happy I did! Hugo is blazingly fast, and Iâ€™ve heard static sites are less prone to hacking, which definitely gives me peace of mind.

Deploying with **Netlify** was a no-brainer. Itâ€™s so simple, and everything just clicks into place perfectly. But let me be realâ€”it wasnâ€™t all smooth sailing.


## How It started


It all started when I was following a tutorial on YouTube. The YouTuber stopped at a certain point, and I got completely stuck. I had never used Hugo beforeâ€”this was my first time! I felt lost and was honestly ready to give up and jump into a new project. But I told myself, "No, you need to finish this."


## MY Biggest Challenge


The biggest challenge was adding a **functional search bar**. I scoured YouTube for videos on how to do it in Hugo and found nothing. I even asked ChatGPT and DeepSeek if they knew of any tutorials. Still nothing! So I changed my strategy: I asked the AIs directly *how to build one*. DeepSeek especially came through with some solid guidelines. After some tinkering, I succeeded in making it work with **Lunr.js**. ([I even wrote a post about it!](/posts/add-search-to-hugo)).

That win gave me the momentum to keep going. Next, I added a **comment section using Utterances** (which hooks right into GitHub issuesâ€”so cool!), set up **Google Analytics** to understand my visitors, and used **Formspree** to add a super simple newsletter signup without any backend hassle.

It wasnâ€™t easy, but the feeling of overcoming those challenges and having a site that I built exactly how I wanted is unbeatable. That said, Iâ€™m still smoothing out a few quirks! For example, my main `app.js` works for categories and dark/light mode, but doesnâ€™t play nicely with the homepage, search bar, or Utterances yetâ€”so Iâ€™m using separate JS files for now. Iâ€™ll tackle that later!

Throughout this process, I used AI not to do the work for me, but as a **guide to learn and find my own answers**. Most importantly, I learned to **be patient, stay focused, and not give up** easily.

If you're thinking about building your own blog, just start. Youâ€™ll hit walls, but I promise you can break through them. Feel free to check out [my site](https://devview.netlify.app/) and let me know what you thinkâ€”Iâ€™d love your feedback in the comments!
