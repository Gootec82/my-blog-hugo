# How I Added Comments to My Hugo Blog (With Utterances)

When I finished building my Hugo blog, one thing was still missing: **a way for readers to leave comments**. Hugo is fast and lightweight, but since it's a static site generator, it doesn't include a built-in comment system like WordPress.

In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through exactly how **I added comments to my Hugo blog using Utterances**, with clear separation between explanations and code examples.

## Why Comments Matter for a Static Blog

Before we dive into the technical implementation, let me share why I believe comments are essential:

- **Reader Engagement** ‚Üí Creates two-way conversations
- **SEO Value** ‚Üí Fresh user-generated content helps rankings  
- **Community Building** ‚Üí Transforms your blog into a hub
- **Valuable Feedback** ‚Üí Understand what readers want
- **Trust Building** ‚Üí Shows real engagement to new visitors

## My Comment System Evaluation Process

I tested several comment systems before settling on Utterances. Here's my analysis:

### Disqus - The Traditional Choice

**The Code:**
```
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script>
var disqus_config = function () {
  this.page.url = "{{ .Permalink }}";
  this.page.identifier = "{{ .File.Path }}";
};
(function() {
  var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
  s.src = 'https://YOUR-SHORTNAME.disqus.com/embed.js';
  s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
  (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
})();
</script>
```

Why I Didn't Choose Disqus:

üö´ Shows ads unless you pay for premium

üö´ Heavy tracking and privacy concerns

üö´ Slows down page loading significantly

üö´ Complex moderation interface

Giscus - GitHub Discussions Alternative
The Code:

```
<script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
        data-repo="gootec82/my-blog-hugo"
        data-repo-id="YOUR_REPO_ID"
        data-category="General"
        data-category-id="YOUR_CATEGORY_ID"
        data-mapping="pathname"
        data-theme="light"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```

Giscus Pros:

‚úÖ Threaded replies and nested comments

‚úÖ Emoji reactions support

‚úÖ GitHub Discussions backend

Why I Didn't Choose Giscus:

‚ö†Ô∏è More complex setup process

‚ö†Ô∏è Requires additional repository configuration

Utterances - The Winner for Me
I ultimately chose Utterances because:

‚úÖ Completely free - no hidden costs

‚úÖ No tracking - privacy-focused

‚úÖ Lightweight - minimal performance impact

‚úÖ GitHub integration - familiar interface

‚úÖ Easy moderation - through GitHub issues

‚úÖ Open source - transparent codebase

Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. GitHub Repository Setup
First, ensure your blog's source code is in a public GitHub repository. Utterances requires this because it uses GitHub Issues for storing comments.

Requirements:

Repository must be public

Utterances app needs access

GitHub Issues must be enabled

2. Installing Utterances App
Install the Utterances app on your GitHub account:

Visit github.com/apps/utterances

Click "Install"

Select your blog's repository

Grant necessary permissions

3. Hugo Template Implementation
Add this code to your layouts/_default/single.html file:

```
<!-- Comments Section -->
<div class="comments-section">
    <h2 class="comments-title">Comments & Discussion</h2>
    <p class="comments-notice">
        Join the conversation using your GitHub account. Comments are powered by Utterances.
    </p>

    <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
            repo="gootec82/my-blog-hugo"
            issue-term="title"
            theme="github-light"
            crossorigin="anonymous"
            async>
    </script>

    <noscript>
        <p class="comments-noscript">
            Please enable JavaScript to view comments.
        </p>
    </noscript>
</div>
4. CSS Styling for Comments
Add this CSS to make comments blend with your design:

css
/* Comments Section Styling */
.comments-section {
    margin: 3rem 0;
    padding: 2rem 0;
    border-top: 1px solid #eaeaea;
}

.comments-title {
    font-size: 1.8rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    color: var(--text-color);
    font-weight: 600;
}

.comments-notice {
    color: #666;
    font-size: 0.95rem;
    margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
    line-height: 1.5;
}

.comments-noscript {
    background: #f8f9fa;
    padding: 1rem;
    border-radius: 8px;
    text-align: center;
    color: #6c757d;
    border: 1px solid #e9ecef;
}

/* Dark mode support */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    .comments-section {
        border-top-color: #2d3748;
    }
    
    .comments-notice {
        color: #a0aec0;
    }
    
    .comments-noscript {
        background: #2d3748;
        border-color: #4a5568;
        color: #cbd5e0;
    }
}
```

5. Dynamic Theme Configuration
For automatic dark/light mode handling:

```
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="gootec82/my-blog-hugo"
        issue-term="title"
        theme="{{ if eq .Site.Params.defaultTheme "dark" }}github-dark{{ else }}github-light{{ end }}"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```

Advanced Configuration Options
Multiple Theme Options

```
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="gootec82/my-blog-hugo"
        issue-term="title"
        theme="github-dark-orange"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```

Available themes: github-light, github-dark, preferred-color-scheme, github-dark-orange, icy-dark, dark-blue, photon-dark

Custom Issue Mapping

```
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="gootec82/my-blog-hugo"
        issue-term="pathname"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```

Mapping options: pathname, url, title, og:title, specific term

  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "{{ .Site.Title }}",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "{{ .Site.BaseURL }}images/logo.webp"
    }
  },
  "mainEntityOfPage": {
