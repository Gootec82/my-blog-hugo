- **Community Contribution** → Sharing what I learn through blogs & open-source

- **Forex & Trading Bots** → Python bots, strategies, and trading automation  

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I’m experimenting with forex trading strategies, building bots, and exploring how fintech is shaping the future of money. I believe technology and finance together can create new opportunities for independence and innovation.
